# SchoolAPI
For our project, we will be creating an API for NJIT to handle online course registration, as well as course management on the admin, professor, and student ends. It will be done by creating a minimally viable product (MVP), which is a product with just enough features to be useable by early customers that can provide feedback for future product development. By creating this API, we will be able to refer to it to create desktop, mobile, and browser apps that can work separately from each other, but achieve the same goal of giving students the ability to register for courses from any device. By setting up this API, NJIT would be able to use these set rules for other applications in the future, such as direct management of courses by administrators, individual course info by professors, and students being able to register and manage their courses through one platform.
